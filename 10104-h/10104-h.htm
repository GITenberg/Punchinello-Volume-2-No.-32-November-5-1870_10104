      <p><b>THE MYSTERY OF MR. E. DROOD,</b></p>
      <p>AN ADAPTATION.</p>
      <p>BY ORPHEUS C. KERR</p>
      <p><b>CHAPTER XXVI.</b></p>
      <p>FOR BETTER, FOR WORSE.</p>
      <p>Miss CARROWTHERS having gone out with Mrs. SKAMMERHORN to
skirmish with the world of dry-goods clerks for one of those alarming
sacrifices in feminine apparel which woman unselfishly, yet never
needlessly, is always making, FLORA sat alone in her new home, working
the latest beaded pin-cushion of her useful life. Frequently
experiencing the truth of the adage, that as you sew so shall you rip,
the fair young thing was passing half her valuable time in ripping out
the mistaken stitches she had made in the other half; and the severe
moral discipline thus endured, made her mad, as equivalent vexation
would have made a man the reverse of that word. Flippant social
satirists cannot dwell with sufficient sarcasm upon the difference
between the invincible amiability affected by artless girls in society
and their occasional bitterness of aspect in the privacy of home; never
stopping to reflect that there are sore private trials for these
industrious young crochet creatures in which the thread of the most
equable female existence is necessarily worsted. Miss POTTS, then,
although looking up from her trying worsted occupation at the servant
who entered with a rather snappish expression of countenance, was
guilty of no particularly hypocritical assumption in at once suffering
her features to relax into a sweetly pensive smile upon learning that
there was a gentleman to see her in the parlor.</p>
      <p>"'MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON,'" she softly read from the card
presented. "Is he alone, BRIDGET, dear?"</p>
      <p>"Sorra any wan with him but his cane, Miss; and that he axed
me wud I sthand it behind the dure for him."</p>
      <p>There was a look of desperate purpose about this. When a
sentimental young man seeks a private interview with a marriageable
young woman, and recklessly refuses at the outset to retain at least
his cane for the solution of the intricate conversational problem of
what to do with his hands, it is an infallible sign that some madly
rash intention has temporarily overpowered his usual sheepish
imbecility, and that he may be expected to speak and act with almost
human intelligence.</p>
      <p>With hand instinctively pressed upon her heart, to moderate
its too sanguine pulsations and show the delicate lace around her
cuffs, FLORA shyly entered the parlor, and surprised Mr. PENDRAGON
striding up and down the apartment like one of the more comic of the
tragic actors of the day.</p>
      <p>"Miss POTTS!" ejaculated the wild young Southern pedestrian,
pausing suddenly at her approach, with considerable excitement of
manner, "scorn me, spurn me, if you will; but do not let sectional
embitterment blind you to the fact that I am here by the request of Mr
DIBBLE."</p>
      <p>"I wasn't scorning and spurning anybody," explained the
startled orphan, coyly accepting the chair he pushed forward. "I'm sure
I don't feel any sectional hatred, nor any other ridiculous thing."</p>
      <p>"Forgive me!" pleaded MONTGOMERY. "I reckon I'm a heap too
sensitive about my Southern birth; but only think, Miss POTTS, what
I've had to go through since I've been amongst you Yankees! Fancy what
it is to be suspected of a murder, and have no political influence."</p>
      <p>"It must be <i>so</i> absurd!" murmured FLORA.</p>
      <p>"I've felt wretched enough about it to become a contributor to
the first-class American comic paper on the next floor below me," he
continued, gloomily. "And here, to-day, without any explanation, your
guardian desires me to come here and wait for him."</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry that's such a trial for you, Mr. PENDRAGON,"
simpered the Flowerpot. "Perhaps you'd prefer to wait on the front
stoop and appear as though you'd just come, you know?"</p>
      <p>"And can you think," cried the young man with increased
agitation "that it would be any trial for me to be in your society,
if&#8212;? But tell me, Miss POTTS, has your guardian the right to dispose of
your hand in marriage?"</p>
      <p>"I suppose so," answered FLORA, with innocent surprise and a
pretty blush; "he has charge of <i>all</i> my money matters, you know."</p>
      <p>"Then it is as I feared," groaned her questioner, smiting his
forehead. "He is coming here to-day to tell you what man of opulence he
wants you to have, and I am to be witness to my own hopelessness!"</p>
      <p>"What makes you think anything so ridiculous, you absurd
thing?" asked the orphan, not unkindly.</p>
      <p>"He as good as said so," sighed the unhappy Southerner. "He
told me, with his own mouth, that he wanted to get you off his hands as
soon as possible, and thought he saw his way clear to do it."</p>
      <p>The girl knew what bitter, intolerable emotions were tearing
the heart of the ill-fated secessionist before her, and, in her own
gentle heart, pitied him.</p>
      <p>"He needn't be so sure about it," she said, with indignant
spirit. "I'll never marry <i>any</i> stranger, unless he's awful
rich&#8212;oh, as rich as anything!"</p>
      <p>"Oh, Miss POTTS!" roared MONTGOMERY, suddenly, folding-down
upon one knee before her, and scratching his nose with a ring upon the
hand he sought to kiss, "why will you not bestow upon me the heart so
generously disdainful of everything except the most extreme wealth? Why
waste your best years in waiting for proposals from a class of Northern
men who occasionally expect that their brides, also, shall have
property, when here I offer you the name and hand of a loving Southern
gentleman, who only needs the paying off of a few mortgages on his
estate in the South to be beyond all immediate danger of starvation?"</p>
      <p>Turning her pretty head aside, but unconsciously allowing him
to retain her hand, she faintly asked how they were to live?</p>
      <p>"Live!" repeated the impetuous lover. "On love, hash, mutual
trust, bread pudding: anything that's cheap. I'll do the washing and
ironing myself."</p>
      <p>"How perfectly ridiculous!" said the orphan, bashfully turning
her head still further aside, and bringing one ear-ring to bear
strongly upon him. "You'd never be able to do fluting and pinking in
the world."</p>
      <p>"I could do anything, with you by my side!" he retorted,
eagerly. Oh, Miss POTTS!&#8212;FLORA!&#8212;think how lonely I am. My sister, as on
may have heard, has accepted Gospeler SIMPSON'S proposal, by mail, for
her hand, and is already so busy quarrelling with his mother that she
is no longer any company for me. My fate is in your hands; it is in
woman's power to either make or marry the roan who loves her&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"Provided, always, that her legal guardian consents,"
interrupted the benignant voice of Mr. DIBBLE, who, unperceived by
them, had entered the room in time to finish the sentence.</p>
      <p>Springing alertly to an upright position, and coughing
excessively, Mr. PENDRAGON was a shamefaced reproach to his whole sex,
while the young lady used the edge of her right foot against a seam of
the carpet with that extreme solicitude as to the result which is
always so entirely deceiving to those who have hoped to see her show
signs of painful embarrassment.</p>
      <p>After surveying them in thoughtful silence for a moment, the
old lawyer bent over his ward, and hugged and kissed her with an
unctuousness justified by his great age and extreme goodness. It was
his fine old way of bestowing an inestimable blessing upon all the
plump younger women of his acquaintance, and the benediction was
conferred on the slightest pretexts, and impartially, up to a certain
age.</p>
      <p>"Am I to construe what I have seen and heard, my dear, as
equivalent to the conclusion of my guardianship?" he asked, smilingly.</p>
      <p>"Oh, please don't be so ridiculous&#8212;oh, I never was so
exquisitely nervous," pleaded the helpless, fluttered young creature.</p>
      <p>"I reckon I've betrayed your confidence, sir," said
MONTGOMERY, desperately; "but you must have known, from hearsay at
least, how I have felt toward this young lady ever since our first
meeting, and should not have exposed me to a temptation stronger than I
could bear. I have, indeed, done myself the honor to offer her the hand
and heart if one who, although but a poor gentleman, will be richer
than kings if she deigns to make him so."</p>
      <p>"Why, how absurd!" ejaculated the orphan, quickly. "It's
perfectly ridiculous to call me well off: and how could I make you
richer than kings and things, you know?"</p>
      <p>The old and the young men exchanged looks of unspeakable
admiration at such touching artlessness.</p>
      <p>"Sweet innocence!" exclaimed her guardian, playfully pinching
her cheek and privately surprised at its floury feeling. "What would
you say if I told you that, since our shrewd EDDY retired from the
contest, I have been wishing to see you and our Southern friend here
brought to just such terms as you appear to have reached? What would
you say if I added that, such consummation seeming to be the best you
or your friends could do for yourself, I have determined to deal with
you as a daughter, in the matter of seeing to it that you begin your
married life with a daughter's portion from my own estate?"</p>
      <p>Both the young people had his hands in theirs, on either side
of him, in an instant.</p>
      <p>"There! there!" continued the excellent old gentleman, "don't
try to express yourselves. FLORA, place one of your hands in the breast
of my coat, and draw out the parcel you find there. * * * That's it.
The article it contains once belonged to your mother, my dear, and has
been returned to me by the hands to which I once committed it in the
hope that they would present it to you. I loved your mother well, my
child, but had not enough property at the time to contend with your
father. Open the parcel in private, and be warned by its moral: Better
is wilful waist than woeful want of it."</p>
      <p>It was the stay-lace by which Mrs. POTTS, from too great
persistence in drawing herself up proudly, had perished in her prime.</p>
      <p>"Now come into the open air with me, and let us walk to
Central Park," continued Mr. DIBBLE, shaking off his momentary fit of
gloom, "I have strange things to tell you both. I have to teach you, in
justice to a much-injured man, that we have, in our hearts, cruelly
wronged that excellent and devout Mr. BUMSTEAD, by suspecting him of a
crime whereof he is now proved innocent at least <i>I</i> suspected
him. To-morrow night we must all be in Bumsteadville. I will tell you
why as we walk."</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>CHAPTER XXVII.</b></p>
      <p>SOLUTION.</p>
      <p>In the darkness of a night made opaque by approaching showers,
a man stands under the low-drooping branches of the edge of a wood
skirting the cross-road leading down to Gospeler's Gulch.</p>
      <p>"Not enough saved from the wreck even to buy the merciful rope
that should end all my humor and impecuniosity!" he mutters, over his
folded arms and heaving chest. "I have come to this out-of-the-way
suburb to end my miserable days, and not so much as one clothes-line
have I seen yet. There is the pond, however; I can jump into that, I
suppose: but how much more decent were it to make one's quietus under
the merry greenwood tree with a cord&#8212;"</p>
      <p>He stops suddenly, holding his breath; and, almost
simultaneously with a sharp, rushing noise in the leaves overhead,
something drops upon his shoulder. He grasps it, cautiously feels of
it, and, to his unspeakable amazement, discovers that it is a rope
apparently fastened to the branches above!</p>
      <p>"Wonderful!" he ejaculates, in an awe-stricken whisper.
"Providence helps a wretch to die, if not to live. At any other time I
should think this very strange, but just now I've got but one thing to
do. Here's my rope, here's my neck, and here goes!"</p>
      <p>Heedless of everything but his dread intention, he rapidly
ties the rope about his throat, and is in the act of throwing forward
his whole weight upon it, when there is a sharp jerk of the rope, he is
drawn up about three feet in the air, and, before he can collect his
thoughts, is as abruptly let down upon his feet again. Simultaneously,
a sound almost like suppressed swearing comes very clearly to his ear,
and he is conscious of something dimly white in the profound darkness,
not far away.</p>
      <p>"Sold again: signed, J. BUMSTEAD," exclaims a deep voice. "I
thought the rope was caught in a crotch; but 'twasn't. Try't once more."</p>
      <p>The astounded hearer feels the rope tugging at his own neck
again, and, with a half comprehension of the situation, calls "Stop!"
in a suffocating voice.</p>
      <p>"Who's there?" comes from the darkness.</p>
      <p>"JEREMY BENTHAM, late proprietor of first-class American Comic
Paper.&#8212;Died of Comic Serial.&#8212;Want to hang myself," is the jerky reply
from the other side.</p>
      <p>"Got your own rope, sir?"</p>
      <p>"No. One fell down on my shoulders just as I was wishing for
it; but it seems to be too elastic."</p>
      <p>"That's the other end 'f <i>my</i> rope, air," rejoins the
second voice, as in wrath. "I threw't over the branches and thought it
had caught, instead of that it let me down, sir."</p>
      <p>"And drew me up," says Mr. BENTHAM.</p>
      <p>Before another word can be spoken by either, the light of a
dark-lantern is flashed upon them. There is Mr. BUMSTEAD, not three
yards from Mr. BENTHAM; each with an end of the same rope about his
neck, and the head of the former turbaned with a damp towel.</p>
      <p>"Are ye men?" exclaims the deep voice of Mr. MELANCTHON
SCHENCK from behind the lantern, "and would ye madly incur death before
having taken out life-policies in the Boreal?"</p>
      <p>"And would my uncle celebrate my return in this style?" cried
still another voice from the darkness.</p>
      <p>"Who's that spoke just then?" cries the Ritualistic organist.</p>
      <p>The answer comes like the note of a trumpet:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"EDWIN DROOD!"</p>
      <p>At the same instant a great glare of light breaks upon the
scene from a bonfire of tar-barrels, ignited at the higher end of the
cross-road by young SMALLEY; and, to the mingled bewilderment and
exasperation of Mr. BUMSTEAD, the radiance reveals, as in noonday, Mr.
SCHENCK and his long-lost nephew standing before him; and, coming
towards them in festive procession from Gospeler's Gulch. MONTGOMERY
PENDRAGON with FLORA on his arm, the Reverend OCTAVIUS SIMPSON
escorting MAGNOLIA, Mr. DIBBLE guarding Mrs. SIMPSON, Mr. CLEW'S arm in
arm with JOHN McLAUGHLIN. Father DEAN and Judge SWEENEY, Miss
CAROWTHERS, and the SMYTHES.</p>
      <p>"Trying to hang yourselves!" exclaims Mr. DIBBLE, as the
throng gathers curiously around the two gentlemen of the rope.</p>
      <p>"And my old friend BENTHAM, too!" cries the Gospeler.</p>
      <p>"How perfectly ridiculous!" warbles FLORA.</p>
      <p>Staring majestically from one face to the other, and from
thence towards the illuminating bonfire, Mr. BUMSTEAD, quite
unconscious of the picturesque effect of the towel on his head,
deliberately draws an antique black bottle from his pocket, moistens
his lips therewith, passes it to the Comic Paper man, and eats a clove.</p>
      <p>"What is the meaning of this general intoxication?" he then
asks quite severely. "Why does this mass-meeting, greatly under the
influence of inferior liquor as it plainly is, intrude thus upon the
last hours of a Ritualistic gentleman and a humorous publisher?"</p>
      <p>"Because, Uncle JACK," returns EDWIN DROOD, holding his hands
curiously behind him as he speaks, "this is a night of general
rejoicing Bumsteadville, in honor of my reappearance; and, directed by
your landlord, Mr. SMYTHE, we have come out to make you join in our
cheer. We are all heartily sorry for the great anguish you have endured
in consequence of my unexplained absence. Let me tell you ow it was, as
I have already told all our friends here. You know where you placed me
while you were in your clove-trance, and I was o unbecomingly asleep,
on Christmas night. Well, I was discovered there, in less than three
hours thereafter, by JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, who carried me to his own house,
and there managed to awaken me. Recovering my senses, I was disgusted
with myself, ashamed of what had happened, and anxious to leave
Bumsteadville. I swore 'Old Mortarity' to secrecy&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"&#8212;Which I have observed," explains MCLAUGHLIN, nodding.</p>
      <p>"&#8212;And started immediately for Egypt, in Illinois," continues
Mr. DROOD. "There I went into railroading; am engaged to a nice little
girl there; and came back two days ago to explain myself all around,
returning here, I saw JOHN MCLAUGHLIN first, who told me that a certain
Mr. CLEWS was here to unravel the Mystery about me, and persuaded me to
let Mr. CLEWS work you into another visit to the cellar the Pauper
Burial Ground, and there appear to you as my own ghost, before finally
revealing myself as I now do."</p>
      <p>The glassy eyes of the Ritualistic organist are fixed upon him
in a most uncomfortable manner, but no comment comes.</p>
      <p>"And I, Mr. BUMSTEAD," says the old lawyer, "must apologize to
you for having indulged a wrong suspicion. Possibly you were rather
rash in charging everybody else with assassination and larceny, and
offering to marry my ward upon the strength of her dislike to you; but
we'll say no more of those things now. Miss POTTS has consented to
become Mrs. PENDRAGON; Miss PENDRAGON is the betrothed of Rev. Mr.
SIMPSON,&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"&#8212;Miss CAROWTHERS honors me with a matrimonial preference,"
interpolates Judge SWEENEY, gallantly bowing to that spinster.&#8212;</p>
      <p>"&#8212;Breachy Mr. BLODGETT!" sighs the lady, to herself.&#8212;</p>
      <p>"&#8212;And three weddings will help us to forget everything but
that which is bright and pleasant," concludes the lawyer.</p>
      <p>Next steps to the front Mr. TRACEY CLEWS, with his surprising
head of hair, and archly remarks:</p>
      <p>"I believe you take me for a literary man, Mr. BUMSTEAD."</p>
      <p>"What is that to me, sir? <i>I've</i> no money to lend,"
returns the organist, with marked uneasiness.</p>
      <p>"To tell you the truth," proceeds the author of "The Amateur
Detective," &#8212;"to tell you the whole truth, I have been playing the
detective with you by order of Mr. DIBBLE, and hope you will excuse my
practice upon you."</p>
      <p>"He is my clerk," explains Mr. DIBBLE.</p>
      <p>Whereupon Mr. TRACEY CLEWS dexterously whips off his brush of
red hair, and stands revealed as Mr. BLADAMS.</p>
      <p>Merely waiting to granulate one more clove, Mr. BUMSTEAD
settles the rope about his neck anew, squints around under the wet
towel in a curiously ghastly manner, and thus addresses the meeting:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"Ladies and gen'l'men&#8212;I've listened to y'r impudence with
patience, and on any other 'casion would be happy to see y'all safe
home. At present, however, Mr. BENTHAM and I desire to be left alone,
if 'ts all th' same t' you. You can come for the bodies in th' morning."</p>
      <p>"BENTHAM! BENTHAM!" calls the Gospeler, "I can't see you
acting in that way, old friend. Come home with me to-night, and we'll
talk of starting a Religious Weekly together. That's your only
successful American Comic Paper."</p>
      <p>"By Jove! so it is!" bawls JEREMY BENTHAM, like one possessed.
"I never thought of that before! I'm with you, my boy." And, hastily
slipping the rope from his neck, he hurries to his friend's side.</p>
      <p>"And you, Uncle JACK&#8212;look at this!" exclaims Mr. E. DROOD,
bringing from behind his back and presenting to the melancholy organist
a thing that looks, at first glance, like an incredibly slim little
black girl, headless, with no waist at all, and balanced on one leg.</p>
      <p>Mr. BUMSTEAD reaches for it mechanically; a look of
intelligence comes into his glassy eyes; then they fairly flame.</p>
      <p>"ALLIE!" he cries, dancing ecstatically.</p>
      <p>It is the Umbrella&#8212;old familiar bone-handle, brass ferrule&#8212;in
a bran-new dress of alpaca!</p>
      <p>All gaze at him with unspeakable emotion, as, with the rope
cast from him, he pats his dear old friend, opens her half way, shuts
her again, and the while smiles with ineffable tenderness.</p>
      <p>Suddenly a shriek&#8212;the voice of FLORA&#8212;breaks the silence:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"It rains!&#8212;oh, my complexion!"</p>
      <p>"Rains?" thunders the regenerated BUMSTEAD, in a tone of
inconceivable triumph. "So it does. Now then, ALLIE, do your duty;"
and, with a softly wooing, hospitable air, he opens the umbrella and
holds it high over his head.</p>
      <p>By a common instinct they all swarm in upon him, craning their
heads far over each other's shoulders to secure a share of the
Providential shelter. The glare of the great bonfire falls upon the
scene; the rain pours down in torrents: they crowd in upon him on all
sides, until what was once a stately Ritualistic man resembles some
tremendous monster with seventeen wriggling bodies, thirty-four legs,
and an alpaca canopy above all.</p>

      <p><b>THE RACE OF THE DAUNTLESS AND CAMBRIA</b>.</p>
      <p>Punchinello's Sporting Special went down to Sandy Hook last
week to supervise the race between the <i>Dauntless</i> and the <i>Cambria</i>.
The affair was consequently a great success.</p>
      <p>Attired in white corduroy breeches, a blue velvet waistcoat,
and a light boating-jacket of yellow flannel, your reporter left the
Battery at 6 hrs. 22 m, and 5 secs, on Friday morning, and steamed
slowly down the bay in the editorial row-boat <i>Punchinelletto</i>,
which was manned by an individual of remarkable oar-acular powers. So
highly was he gifted indeed in this respect, that your special was
enabled to predict the result of the aquatic gambols with perfect
accuracy, as it afterward appeared. Having got the yachts in position,
he gave Messrs. BENNETT and ASHBURY an audience, in which it was
settled by your representative that, owing to a split in the <i>Cambria's</i>
club-topsail, both parties should carry their block-headed jibs; and
the contest was begun.</p>
      <p>In his anxiety to see fair play, however, your reporter at
first innocently took the lead, shooting off, at the given signal, far
in advance of the two yachts. His surprise was therefore great when the
latter suddenly hove to on their beam-ends, and declared an armistice,
to permit of Mr. ASHBURY'S publishing the following:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Card</i>.</p>
      <p>Much as I appreciate the kindness and attention extended to me
on all previous occasions in these waters, I must still politely insist
that the <i>Punchinelletto</i> relinquish her natural and perhaps
unavoidable tendency to take the wind out of everybody's sails, and
submit to remain in the wake of these yachts during the continuance of
the race. And I hereby challenge all fast-sailing yachts of over 100
tons burthen, and under 50, to a 15-mile race dead to windward and back
again alive.</p>
      <p>(Signed) ASHBURY.</p>
      <p>Upon this your reporter manned the yard-arms, fired a salute
of 100 guns, and directed the Oar-acular to back water; thereby giving
the <i>Dauntless</i> the lead, which she retained up to the end of the
race. By the clever management of her Tacks she succeeded in completely
Nailing the <i>Cambria</i>. On the home-stretch, however, the latter
began "eating up "on her to such an alarming degree, that it was feared
the provisions of the Dauntless would not hold out. By putting the crew
on half-rations of champagne and sponge-cake this awful calamity was
averted.</p>
      <p>Excited by the presence of danger, your reporter forgot his
habitual caution, and giving his Oar-ist a hearing, made all sail for
the mark-boat. The tow-line was passed from the bows aft, and there
attached to the boat-hook, held by your representative. Upon this
impromptu clothes-line was crowded all the canvas, velvet, linen, and
other dry-goods appertaining to the gallant captain and his
self-sacrificing crew. The latter gentleman might have been seen under
this gay cloud of drapery working fitfully but energetically to and
fro. But 't was all in vain! The <i>Dauntless</i> passed the
mark-boat, and the race was won. Won? But by whom?</p>
      <p>The daily papers, with their usual inaccuracy, have made it
appear that the <i>Dauntless</i> was the winner, but among thinking
men there is but one opinion in regard to the matter, an opinion fully
explained and corroborated in the following, published by Mr. ASHBURY,
immediately on the <i>Punchinelletto</i> passing the mark-boat:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Card</i>.</p>
      <p>I take this opportunity of saying that whatever
misunderstanding may have arisen in the early part of this race as to
the position of the <i>Punchinelletto</i>, it is now but just to admit
that she has shown herself worthy, both in point of speed and
management, to take rank among the first-class yachts of the fleet, and
I hereby challenge, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
      <p>(Signed) ASHBURY.</p>
      <p>This was further supplemented by a</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Card</i> from Mr. BENNETT.</p>
      <p>In token of my concurrence in the brilliant success of the <i>Punchinelletto</i>,
and my personal esteem for her commander, I hereby beg to place at his
disposal my yacht <i>Dauntless</i>, together with all her stores,
ordnance, by-laws, and small arms.</p>
      <p>(Signed) BENNETT.</p>
      <p>In reply to both of which your reporter circulated the
following:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Reply</i>.</p>
      <p>It is my express desire that no public mention shall be made
of the part by which the <i>Dauntless</i> was permitted apparently to
win the race. It is the duty of him who might have been victor to
display a magnanimous spirit to those who in that case would have been
the vanquished. I must, however, regret that circumstances of a
peculiar nature prevent my availing myself of Mr. BENNETT's kind offer.
Though this will not stand in the way of my accepting with
pleasure&#8212;nay, even with alacrity&#8212;the $250 silver cup appointed for the
winner of to-day's race, as the just meed of one who, though of a
naturally retiring disposition, is forced on the present occasion to
acknowledge himself <i>facile princeps</i>.</p>
      <p>(Signed) Sporting Spec, <i>vice</i> PUNCHINELLO.</p>
      <p>After waiting for Mr. BENNETT'S gig, or water-buggy, to row up
and award the prize, your special nodded majestically to the
Oar-acular, who thereupon steamed slowly up the bay again, arriving at
the Battery in the rosy dawn.</p>

      <p><b>THE PLAYS AND SHOWS</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/88.jpg" align="left" alt="P">retty <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> Margarat asks me to go to church
with her. She is not a New Yorker&#8212;or, as Webster would probably say,&#8212;a
New Yorkeress. She is rural in her ways and thoughts, a daisy of the
fields. Never having seen the interior of a city church, she asks me to
go with her to any Protestant church that I may select. So we go to the
shrine of St. APOLLOS, which, I am told, is regarded as one of the most
fashionable houses in the city.</p>
      <p>It is a matinee service that we elect to attend. A long
procession of carriages is drawn up beside the building as we enter,
and I recognize in the coachmen the familiar faces that wait outside
the ACADEMY on opera nights. The organ overture is already begun, and
the audience is rapidly assembling. We enter the parquette&#8212;I should
say, the body of the church&#8212;and, standing in picturesque attitudes
against the wall, wait for the coming of the usher. We continue to
wait. Evidently the usher, in common with his kind, despises those who
are not holders of reserved seats. He welcomes with a smile the owners
of private boxes&#8212;pews, I mean&#8212;and shows them politely up the aisle; but
for us, who have not even an order from the mana&#8212;, sexton, I should
say&#8212;he has neither smile nor glance.</p>
      <p>By and by I pluck up courage and pluck him by the sleeve. So,
with a severe air of suppressed indignation, he shows us to a couple of
ineligible seats, where the draft disarranges MARGARET'S hair, and the
charity children drop books of the op&#8212;, that is to say, prayer-books,
and molasses candy in unpleasant proximity to our helpless feet.</p>
      <p>Neither MARGARET nor I possess a libret&#8212;, a prayer-book I
mean. However, that is a matter of no consequence, as we are both
familiar with the dialog&#8212;, or rather the service. The organist having
ended his overture, the service begins. Not even the wretched method of
the tenor&#8212;I refer of course to the clerk&#8212;and his miserably affected
execution of the recitative passages, can mar the beauty of the words.
The audience evidently feels their solemn import. The young lady and
the young male person who sit immediately in front of me clasp
surreptitious hands as they bow their heads to repeat the confession
that they are miserable sinners, and she whispers by no means softly to
him of the "frightful bonnets the SMITH girls have on." Presently the
recitative of the clerk is succeeded by a contest in chanting&#8212;probably
for the championship&#8212;by two rival choruses of shrill-voiced boys, who
hurl alternate verses of the Psalms at one another with the fiercest
intensity. MARGARET is betrayed into an inadvertent competition with
them, by reading a verse aloud, as had been her custom elsewhere, but
the charity children smile aloud at her, and the usher frowns, so she
sits down again with reddened cheeks.</p>
      <p>I say to her, "that this choir contest is an excellent
feature, one that is sure to draw." But she answers nothing, and busily
reads the libret&#8212;, the psalm, to herself.</p>
      <p>Then comes the litany. And here again MARGARET betrays her
rural habits, by repeating audibly the first response, thus encroaching
on the province of the choir-boys, who have now united, and form a fine
and powerful chorus, less picturesque perhaps than the Druidical chorus
in the first act of <i>Norma</i>, but quite as religious in its
effect. After which comes a hymn, executed by a soprano, who is really
a deserving little girl, and whom I little expected to find doing the
leading business in a first-class church, when I first saw her in the
chorus at the Stadt Theatre, seven years ago. MARGARET, warned by
experience, does not venture to interfere with the singing, to the
evident disappointment of the usher, who is watching her with the
intention, plainly expressed on his face, of peremptorily putting her
out, if she sings a single note. Then comes a recitation of the
commandments by the leading male perfor&#8212;, that is to say, by the
rector, supported by the double chorus, and the orches&#8212;, the organ, I
should say; and then we have the sermon.</p>
      <p>I like the sermon. It is delivered with admirable effect, and
is, on the whole, more soothing than the average syrup of the
apocryphal Mrs. WINSLOW. The rector compliments us all on our many
virtues, and contrasts us with the supposititious sinners who are
presumed to abound somewhere in the vicinity of rival houses. The
middle-aged men evidently feel that he will make no mistake worth
noticing, and so go to sleep as calmly as though they were at BOOTH'S
THEATRE. The middle-aged ladies contemplate the dresses of their
neighbors, and the young people flirt with cautious glances. When the
curtain&#8212;when it is over, I mean&#8212;we go cheerfully away, like an audience
that has slept through a Shakesperean play, and feels that it has done
its duty. And when we are once more in the street, I say to MARGARET:
"This has been a delightful performance. There has been nothing said to
make one feel disagreeably discontented with one's self, nor has there
been any impolite suggestions as to the undesirable future of anybody,
except the low wretches who, of course, don't go to any church. How
much better this is than the solemn service, and, the unpleasantly
personal sermons that we used to hear at your little rural church."</p>
      <p>MARGARET.&#8212;"I do not like it. Why should boys be hired to pray,
and women to sing for me? Why should I be told by the preacher that I
am perfectly good, when I have just confessed that I am a 'miserable
sinner?' Why do you call this service religious, and Rip Van Winkle
theatrical? Believe me, St. APOLLOS deserves a place among your 'Plays
and Shows' quite as much as does BOOTH'S or WALLACK'S."'</p>

remarking how pleasant it was in this fall season to find all the

      <p>Behold the gentle Poet, now in the midst of the tumult of war.
How calmly he surveys from his elevated position the situation of the
hosts and the signs of the times. He hears the drums beat and the bugle
call to arms, and his soul is filled with martial ardor. Unable to
wield the sword, he seizes his poetical pen, resolved to become the
Chronicler and Historian of the war, and thus add his little mite for
the improvement of future generations. He decided that it must be
characteristic, and in keeping in style with his other productions:
short, pithy, and comprehensive; simple and amusing enough for a child;
deep and sarcastic enough for the most astute mind.</p>
      <p>He begins by describing in graphic style the sounds that first
struck on his ear and fired his manly soul&#8212;the beat of the rolling
drum. Then comes a description of the terrible conflict that occurred
in his native village, between the three most prominent men of the day.
This, not to be too verbose, he simply likens to being "in a tub."</p>
      <p>BILLY the butcher, stout, red-faced, and pugilistic, with his
particular friend MARC the baker, having become jealous of the
beautiful shop and immense patronage of JOHNNY the candlestick-maker,
resolve to put an end to it in some way, even if they have to fight him.</p>
      <p>That showy candlestick shop, with its gay trimmings and
beautiful ornaments, open every day before their face and eyes, and
attracting crowds of idlers who stand gazing in at the windows, or
lounging around the doors, is a little too much for the Butcher, who in
vain displays before his door the fresh-cut meat and the tempting
sausage. True, he has plenty of customers; but they come because they
need what he has to sell; they come of necessity, not for pleasure. The
Baker experiences the same vexation, as he sees his loaves passed by
and mockingly made light of.</p>
      <p>They bear awhile in silent envy the annoying sight of the
rollicking crowd and the joyful JOHNNY with his troop of apprentices,
who have all they can possibly do to attend to their numerous
customers, and who receive their broad pieces of money with a careless
ease that makes the fingers of the lookers-on tingle.</p>
      <p>At last human nature can stand it no longer. The two malicious
storekeepers put their heads together, and resolve to draw their
prosperous enemy into a fight that will ruin him and enable them to
smash his windows. Accordingly, they throw stones and dirt at him, but
he, intently interested in his store, notices them not. His noisy
apprentices and loungers around see and point out the insult, and urge
him to avenge himself. But no; he has no time to pay attention to petty
annoyances; he is too busy getting up a huge candlestick for the Fair,
and so, to smooth matters over, he sends his two enemies an invitation
to view the magnificent candlestick that is to throw so much light on
the world.</p>
      <p>"He is either too stupid or too sharp for us," sighs the
Baker; "we can't do anything in that way. Suppose we set up an
opposition store, with one of your sons for Proprietor, and see what
effect that will have."&#8212;"Good, it shall be done," says the Butcher.</p>
      <p>Soon an empty store adjoining is hired, and being put in
order, when the hitherto blind Proprietor wakes up to the fact that
there is a coalition against him, and that he had better be stirring or
he will lose his trade. Accordingly he writes a remonstrance to his
friend the Butcher, telling him "he wishes no rival in the trade. He
has always had a monopoly, and he intends to keep it." His apprentices
back him up in his assertions, and declare they are ready to die for
him and their candlesticks. The advent of the messenger is noticed with
inward rejoicing by the twain, but, when he presents his remonstrance,
he is immediately kicked out of doors.</p>
      <p>That is the last feather, the one straw too much, and the
excitable little Candlestick-maker at once challenges his opponents to
deadly combat.</p>
      <p>The Poet, with a sublime contempt for the mysterious and
wonderful intricacies of war, significantly calls this rush to arms a
"jumping into a rotten potato."</p>
      <p>Alas! it proves a rotten potato to the poor Candlestick-maker.
Out sallies the Butcher with his cleaver, and his boys with their
knives, and by his side the Baker with his rolling-pin, followed by his
crowd of friends armed with toasting-forks and cutting-irons,
presenting a formidable front to the astonished JOHNNY and his handful
of apprentices.</p>
      <p>But there is no back-door to creep out through now; so at it
they go, Valor against Might, but Might is the stronger, and Valor gets
knocked on the head and has to fall back. This exasperates the heroic
defenders of the shop, who exclaim, "If you can't fight any better than
that, you had better leave," and immediately begin an attack in his
rear.</p>
      <p>The poor man, astonished at this unlooked-for defection from
his ranks, turns his eyes imploringly around for aid, but sees none
that can avail him. He hears on all sides the shout, "Clear out, clear
out. If you can't win the battle for yourself, we will win it for
ourselves, and keep the spoils." Sadly he views the situation; he feels
the kicks of the Candlestick-makers in the rear, and he knows there is
no hope for him. But his beloved store! he will save that if he can; he
will offer himself as a sacrifice.</p>
      <p>With compressed lips he walks to the Butcher, and says, "You
have got the best of me; I'll give in. Stop the fighting." BILLY,
overjoyed at the victory, embraces him, and is about to give the order
for retreat, when the wily Baker whispers, "The shop is there yet, and
it is that that troubles us as much as the man. Let us keep at it till
we demolish it, and thus put a stop to all future controversy. After
killing the old fox, don't leave a nest of young ones to grow up and
bite us. What is their loss is our gain, you know. Do you understand?"

      <p><b>HIGH-HANDED OUTRAGE.</b></p>
      <p>EDITOR OF PUNCHINELLO: Sir:&#8212;I am the young lady, travelling in
New Jersey (perhaps they will next make a crime of <i>that</i>!), and
mentioned in a recent paragraph as having been asked by a person
(called a <i>man</i>) "if <i>this</i> was ELIZABETH?"</p>
      <p>I insist, Sir, that I was right in resenting, as I did, the
impudent familiarity of this person (called a <i>man</i>), who, after
sitting for an hour or two in perfect silence (having first intruded
himself into the seat beside me without making any kind of apology),
abruptly turns to me and says, "Is <i>this</i> ELIZABETH?"</p>
      <p>I insist, Sir, that I was right in asking the ruffian what he
meant. Consider the abruptness, Sir, of this question&#8212;this selfish
question, as it turned out, after a grim and gruff silence of an hour
and a quarter. Could not this unamiable person (called a <i>man</i>),
have prepared me for it by a few moments' affable conversation? Why
should he dare intrude his "Is this ELIZABETH?" with such brutal
abruptness? Not a sudden proposal from one of my numerous suitors could
have startled me more.</p>
      <p>Look at the question, Sir, as pointing at my supposed
Christian name (I <i>have</i> one, but it is <i>not</i> ELIZABETH,
nor yet ELIZA); can you imagine anything more odiously familiar? "Well
known for his mild and gentle disposition" this "gentleman" of Brooklyn
may be; but there was no mildness, no gentleness this time, I assure
you! The language alone proves <i>that</i>!</p>
      <p>The rudeness was all the more shocking and discomposing, from
the fact that I was at that moment contemplating the elegant features
of a gentleman at the other end of the car, who seemed not altogether
indifferent to my appearance (which he would have been, perhaps, had I
seemed of "uncertain age," as the low fellow observes who wrote this
paragraph), and there was every appearance of a growing interest in two
susceptible hearts, when this cold-blooded (but "mild and gentle")
person launched his brutal interrogatory, so selfish and unfeeling,
with such violent abruptness.</p>
      <p>Look, if you will, Sir, at the question as referring purely to
the city which we were approaching. How did I know that my new found,
but already dear friend was not about to alight (as, indeed, he seemed
to be), and leave me to the disgusting society of this "mild and
gentle" barbarian sitting beside me in such a state of stolid
indifference, and thinking only of a vulgar town, and his still more
vulgar affairs in that town!</p>
      <p>Consider again, Sir, the audacity of this person (called a <i>man</i>),
in repeating his odious question after the rebuke I had administered!
Yes, he actually repeated it! as though I were a long-lost
acquaintance, of whose identity he felt more than doubtful; I simply
said to him (though the slanderous report says I <i>screamed</i> it),
"You may think you are a gentleman, Sir" (and here I claim is evinced a
disposition to be fair even to an enemy)&#8212;"you may <i>think</i> you are
a gentleman, Sir, to address a lady so; but I do not wish to continue
any further talk with you."</p>
      <p>You may fancy the state of my feelings, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, at
being obliged to make this little speech, and my friend at the other
end of the car looking on, with wonder in every one of his expressive
features, and the conductor at that instant coming in and shouting,
"ELIZABETH!" as though I were called for and must go that very instant.
Indeed, I felt very much like doing so&#8212;but not, I assure you, on
perceiving that the "mild and gentle" ogre I have been speaking of was
already going out. No; I was thankful I was going further, though the
behavior of the remaining passengers was not calculated to inspire me
with a very quieting sense of ease.</p>
      <p>You will, I am sure, excuse the feelings of a lady who has
been insulted by a ruffianly person (called a <i>man</i>), and
affronted by a car-full of insolent and vulgar mob, called the American
Public. I hope the gentleman at the other end of the car will take for
granted that <i>he</i> was not one of this brutal mob.</p>

      <p>"H. G. OF THE <i>Tribune</i>, I believe," said I, reaching
out and taking his lilly-white hand, one Saturday mornin at Chattaqua.</p>
      <p>"Jess so," said he, politely, "and this is H.G. of
PUNCHINELLO. We're a helthy team at writin' comic essays&#8212;eh! Squire?"
And the hills, dales, and barn-yards resounded with our innercent
prattle.</p>
      <p>"My bizziness, Mister GREELEY, is to see if you know as much
about agricoltural economy as you do about politikle economy. As I
useter say to culprits, who was bein tried before me when I was Gustise
of the Peece, you needent say nothin which will criminate yourself."</p>
      <p>"Well, my lerned friend," said he, hily pleased at my happy
way of puttin' things, "foller me, and I'le show you what farmin on
scientific prenciples can do for a man."</p>
      <p>Arm in arm we sailed forth, as gay and festiv as a pair of
turkle doves&#8212;HORRIS with his panterloons stuffed in his bute legs, and
the undersined with his specturcals adjusted on his nose.</p>
      <p>"Do you see that piece of land over yender?" said he, pintin
to a strip of 10 akers. "That was a worthless swamp two yeer ago. For
$15,000.00 I made it what it is, and to-day, I'me proud to say it, my
farm is worth $1,750.00 more, with that 10 akers under cultivation,
than it was before I drained it."</p>
      <p>"HORRIS," said I, wishin to humor him, "as an economist, this
shows your brains is in the rite spot."</p>
      <p>He then took me in his garden, and showed me what his success
in the sass bizziness had been. "Do you see that 10 aker bed?" said he.
"Well! last fall I saw a lot of pie plant growing in a wild state. I
said nothin to nobody, but when it got ripe I saved the seed. This
spring I planted that patch of ground with it, anticipatin the biggest
crop of pie timber in the State. And, sir, jest as sartin as this white
hat was once new," said he, pintin to his old plade out shappo, "when
that stuff grode to maturity, I sent a cart lode down to the market,
and it was all sent back with a note, statin that burdocks wasn't worth
a cuss for pies. But," said he, takin me by the button-hole, "no man
can fool me agin on pie timber."</p>
      <p>"As a farmer, HORRIS," said I, so as to keep the rite side of
him, "your ekal hasent been hatched."</p>
      <p>He then shode me the remains of a young orchird; said he: "The
borers got into the roots of them trees, which trees cost me, within
the last two yeer, about $5,000.00. I tried all sorts of ways to get
rid of them. I even set my hired man to readin artikles on 'What I know
of farmin' to 'em. This put the grubs to sleep 'long at first, but they
finally stopt their ears up with clay, and wouldent listen. So that
dodge was plade out. I then bought a lot of ile of vitril and poured it
about the roots of them trees, and I tell you, friend GREEN," said he,
as tickled as a boy with his first pair of new boots, "it would have
made you laff to see them borers moosey."</p>
      <p>"But," said I, "it killed them trees deader'n a smelt."</p>
      <p>"Which don't amount to shucks, so long as the cause of
sientific farmin is benifitted, by showin bugs that the superior
critter man is too many meesles for the animile kingdom," was his reply.</p>
      <p>"Them trees over there," said this distingished farmer, "was a
present to me. They come marked <i>pine</i> trees. It is over three
yeers since they was sot out, and not a solitary <i>pine apple</i>
have they yielded yet. I reckon it takes time for them to bear fruit,"
said he in his simplisity.</p>
      <p>"Not only time," said I, somewhat surprised, "but if you live
through all etarnity, you won't see a darned apple on them trees."</p>
      <p>"But, Squire GREEN," said he, with a downcast air, "H. WARD
BEECHER says pine apples grows on pine trees, and as long as brother B.
spends all his salary in edicatin hisself for a farmer, he orter know."</p>
      <p>"Brother fiddlesticks," said I, a little riled at hearin him
cote H.W.B. as a farmist. "HANK is a 4 hoss team at raisin food for the
sowl; but when you come to depend on sich chaps to raise grub and other
vegetables for the stomack, excoose me for sayin it, it haint H. WARD'S
fort, no more'n it is mine to outsing NILLSON for the beer."</p>
      <p>We entered his poultry yard.</p>
      <p>"You're old peaches on raisin fouls, I've been told," said I.</p>
      <p>"Ker-r-rect," said he, "chickens is my best holt. Last spring
I had a favorite speckled hen&#8212;she was the specklest biped which ever
wore feathers. One day, I sot her on 300 eggs. That fowl done her level
best and spread evry feather, but she hadent enuff elasticity to cover
so much territory at one settin."</p>
      <p>"Well, sir," said he, straitenin his form, up to its full
hite, "Sients come to my ade. I got a feather bed, and with a glue pot
bilt out that hen's spread."</p>
      <p>"What," I says, "the hen dident hatch all them eggs?"</p>
      <p>"Not exsactly," was his reply; "she would have hatched every
egg, but&#8212;but&#8212;but&#8212;," and he broke down and bust into teers.</p>
      <p>"But&#8212;why?" I asked, soothin his perturbed spirrit.</p>
      <p>"She had a great deal of pride that hen did. She was terribly
stuck up. Just as she got settled down for a good square old-fashioned
set, she was so proud of her position, that somehow or other, it struck
      <i>in</i> and killed her."</p>
      <p>We visited his barn, which was chock full of farmin tools.
Said he:</p>
      <p>"It is allers a mistery to peeple how I make farmin pay, but,
Squire, between you and I, heer's where I reckon I've got 'em. Where I
loses in other branches I make up heer. Any and everybody which invents
a farmin masheen sends me one, and I gives them a puff. Every 30 days I
gets up a bee, to which I invites the nabors. With hammers we knock
them masheens to pieces, and, sir!" said he, blowin his bugle horn of
liberty with his cote sleeve, "as the Roman mother once said, 'these is
my tressoors,' for, sure's your born, the sales of old iron more'n pays
runnin my farm, losses and all."</p>
      <p>The shades of nite was a fallin, so thankin H.G. for posten me

      <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: Hailing (not to say reigning) from this
august (and all the year round) place, I naturally feel privileged to
pour my troubles into your ears, with doubts as to their length.
[Length of what, troubles or ears?&#8212;ED.]</p>
      <p>The fact is, no man was ever treated so badly or so seldom as
I have been. Others have "waked up" and found themselves famous. I've
practised waking for years, and never found myself in fame, or anything
else, excepting energetic "tailors' bills," and an occasional square
meal.</p>
      <p>Thirsting for renown, I have coined my wealth of brains into
one transcending effort, and amid much travail of genius, and travel of
paw to pate, have produced the following</p>

      <p>which I dedicate to the late Political Convention, as
embodying the principles there adopted, with this difference, that,
while their Resolutions have no point, my resolution enables me to make
two points in every line.</p>
      <p>While I'm not in the proverb business, I have a couple on hand
that are getting mouldy, so I send 'em along.</p>
      <p>"Once go to grass, and your enemies will soon make a hey-day
over you."</p>
      <p>"Get all you can, and can all you get."</p>
      <p>But that reminds me of a Beautiful Tale:&#8212;</p>
      <p>Deacon K---- lacked the confidence of the inhabitants of
M----. He was most sincerely detested for his hypocrisy and
double-dealing, and so very unpopular, that a few wags conceived the
idea of drawing up a paper requesting him to leave town.</p>
      <p>Once endorsed by two or three respectable names, the joke
took; the paper circulated like wildfire and soon contained every
business name in the place.</p>
      <p>A most horrible position to occupy in respect to one's
neighbors.</p>
      <p>But the Deacon was a genius in his way. Getting possession of
the document, he adroitly changed the heading, and behold! the intended
rebuke was transformed into a humble petition to the President that
Deakon K---- be appointed Postmaster of M----. In due time the
appointment came, much to the consternation and chagrin of the
villagers.</p>
      <p>The position was held one season in spite of all opposition;
but the Deacon did not prosper in the end, for after wandering about
the streets of New York a miserable outcast, he naturally drifted on to
the editorial staff of the <i>Sun</i>. The End.</p>
      <p>Trusting, my dear 'NELLO, you will give me a good setting-up,
and cast my lines in pleasant places, I remain,</p>
      <p>Yours in fun,</p>
      <p>S. R. DEEN.</p>

      <p><b>TIMELY.</b></p>
      <p>They now put little watches on the outside of portemonnaies
and cigar-cases. There has been doubt expressed as to the value of
these time-pieces; but if they go as certainly as the money and the
cigars, they will do very well.</p>

      <p><b>MR. PUNCHINELLO'S POLITICAL MANUAL.</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">I. QUALIFICATIONS OF A VOTER.</p>
      <p><img src="images/95b.jpg" align="left" alt="N">ow and then Mr. PUNCHINELLO has noticed (with infinite scorn
and contempt) all the stuff and nonsense published in the newspapers
about registry and inspection, about citizenship and twenty-one years
of age, and other games and devices of that soft sort. The
qualifications of a voter may be stated with severe and scientific
accuracy, as follows:&#8212;</p>
      <p><i>Ubiquity.</i>&#8212;By this is to be understood the power, not of
      <i>being</i>, but of <i>belonging</i> in from six to twelve
Wards at the same time. Analogous to this is the capacity of being at
once a subject of VICTORIA REGINA and a loyal citizen of the United
States&#8212;a talent most exquisitely developed in the Hibernian nature.</p>
      <p><i>Receptivity</i>.&#8212;This may be divided into two classes, as
follows:&#8212;</p>
      <p>1. The material power, which is that of receiving from any
candidate any sum of money which, the said ass of a candidate may be
willing to pay for a vote.</p>
      <p>2. The spiritual power, which is that of imbibing, at the
expense of the aforesaid candidate, any number of fluid pounds of
anything good to take, whether the same may be punches, cock-tails,
smashes, slings, or plain drinks.</p>
      <p><i>Pugnacity</i>.&#8212;This is a quality by no means to be lightly
spoken of, especially in a District represented by that eminent
warrior, the Hon. Mr. MORRISSEY. Our fathers fought, bled, and died for
liberty, and the least an independent citizen can do is to be willing
to fight and bleed (and even he "kilt") in the same behalf. There is a
difference, however, between dying and being "kilt," which we need not
point out to those noble champions of liberty who are also of the
Celtic persuasion.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">II. QUALIFICATIONS OF AN EDITOR.</p>
      <p><i>Mendacity</i>.&#8212;This is a talent mainly developed in the
manipulation of election returns. But it may be exhibited in various
other ways. Here, for instance, is an obnoxious candidate who is a
quiet, respectable, honest, church-going family man. The height of
mendacious talent is shown in representing this paragon of virtue to be
a brawler, a blackguard, a swindler, an infidel, and a bad husband and
father. If he mildly denies that he is any such person, the proper
course is to call him all the unpleasant names over again, adding, by
way of clincher, that he is popularly supposed to have murdered his
grandmother. This will floor him.</p>
      <p><i>Verbosity</i>.&#8212;This is the power of writing two columns in
answer to a three-line paragraph&#8212;of twisting, turning, transmogrifying,
dissecting, kicking, cuffing, illustrating, turning inside out, and
outside in again the aforesaid paragraph. The real master of this art
will show his skill by the great number of times in which he will
manage to say "We" in the course of his lucubration.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">III. QUALIFICATIONS OF A CANDIDATE.</p>
      <p><i>Density</i>.&#8212;This indicates the utter incapacity of a
candidate to understand any public question. It is a very safe quality,
for the more he knows, the less likely is he to commit himself. It is
an equally pleasant quality, since it enables its possessor to take the
fence and to maintain it, while, by a sort of optical delusion, each
party supposes him to be upon its own side. It saves regular out and
out <i>lying</i>, if Mr. GREELEY will allow us to use so strong a
word. For instance, if asked, "Are you in favor of a Protective
Tariff?" the candidate may answer, "I am" (for he doesn't know whether
he is) or "I am not" (for he does not know but he may be a most
cantankerous Free Trader). In this way he may, with Roman honesty,
satisfy everybody, and promote peace and good-will and that sort of
thing in the handsomest manner.</p>
      <p><i>Capillary Attraction</i>.&#8212;This is analogous to receptivity
in the voter. If the citizen drinks hugely, the candidate must be able
to keep up with him; and to have a sponge stomach equal to the
absorption of quarts, and even of gallons, is a piece of excellent good
fortune for the man who is fool enough to want to go to Congress,
instead of enjoying the delights of obscurity. Verily, he has his
reward. He who suffers in the gin-mills of New York may recover himself
in the Champagne-sparkling saloons of Washington.</p>
      <p><i>Pecuniosity</i>.&#8212;"To him that hath shall be given." The
candidate must beg, borrow, or steal something to begin with. He must
possess a power of bleeding equal to that of twenty-four country
doctors.</p>
      <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO has here given a skeleton sketch of his great
work upon politics. The reader had better make the most of it; for the
Great Book will not be published until after the author's death, which
he doesn't think (if he knows himself) is likely to happen tomorrow.
And so he closes with a brief exhortation: Go on, worthy gentlemen!
Continue to spend, drink, war, falsify, for the good of your country!
Are you a Voter? Show yourself to be such indeed, by voting all day,
all the time, and at all the polling-places! Are you a Candidate? Show
yourself to be a good one by keeping your mouth shut (except for
drinking) and your pocket open! Are you an Editor? Ah! Mr. P. has
nothing to say to you. Mr. P. is an Editor too! We understand each
other, worthy brother! We know where the world keeps its cakes and ale!</p>

      <p><b>CAPITAL REMOVAL.</b></p>
      <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO having been invited to attend and address the
Capital Removal Convention (so called) held in Cincinnati, wrote a
letter declining to be present, upon the ground that he was exceedingly
comfortable where he was. However, he added his views at great length,
but the ingrates did not even read his letter. In this he advocated the
removal of the Capitol to some point so distant that twenty-three
months of an Honorable Member's term of twenty-four months would be
spent in going and returning. At the same time Mr. P. suggested the
abolition of the salaries of the Members; and the passage of an act
making it a forgery for any member to print in <i>The Globe</i> a
never-uttered speech. But, alas for the wisdom of age! he doesn't see
that the Convention acted on any of these suggestions.</p>

      <p><b>SARSFIELD YOUNG'S REMINISCENCES OF CHARLES DICKENS.</b></p>
      <p>It is surprising that since Mr. DICKEN'S decease no one should
have conceived the idea of writing a sketch of that illustrious author.
It is perhaps too much to require that some competent person prepare
his biography, but the public have a right to expect at least a few
reminiscences. I am persuaded to sketch the following imperfect
outlines only from a conviction that the great novelist has in this
respect been neglected. I trust I shall not be deemed to have broken
the seal of private confidence in this disclosing how well I knew him,
and (what is still more remarkable) how well he knew me:&#8212;</p>
      <p>[While Mr. DICKENS was on his first visit to this country, the
writer had not the pleasure of his acquaintance. He put up in
Philadelphia, at a well-known and fashionable boarding-house then kept
by an aunt of mine, at the corner of Second and Thirteenth streets. He
never said anything while there, until he came to pay his board bill,
when bidding my aunt farewell, he observed: <i>"Mrs. SAGOE, for
terseness and brevity, your steaks surpass any I have ever met with."</i>
Aunt Sarah had these words neatly framed, and they have hung in her
back parlor to this day.</p>
      <p>Before he came again, the country had made wonderful progress.
A new generation had been born, including myself.]</p>
      <p>When the steamer was signalled, I went down on the wharf.
DICKENS was standing near the rail, and wore a coat, vest, pants, and a
hat. I couldn't make out through the glass how much they cost, and I
forgot to ask him afterward. Shortly after she had hauled into the
dock, I went on board. We shook hands. Mr. DICKENS had a peculiar way
of reserving his right hand for this process, though on great occasions
he would use both. We employed all four, with the understanding that a
more formal demonstration should be made at PARKER'S. I offered to
carry his valise. Graciously declining my services, he betokened his
appreciation of my delicate attention by presenting me on the spot with
a complete set of his works&#8212;Author's Edition.</p>
      <p>"My dear fellow," he whispered, "there's a Boston man down
below, blacking my other pair of boots, who'd feel hurt if I should let
anybody else take that bag."</p>
      <p>I called upon him as soon as he was fairly settled, and found
him in his shirt-sleeves, writing vigorously. Mr. DICKENS'S intimate
friends are aware that he indulged in the habit, while writing, of
occasionally dipping his pen in the inkstand. I don't remember much
about the room except that there were several chairs (good chairs) and
a table in it. The distinguished occupant was sitting about nine and a
half feet from the door facing the Southwest, his hair well brushed,
head a little inclined to the right, except his eyes, which, were
inclined to twinkle as though he had just hit upon something
particularly bright and happy. The carpet was green with a red figure.
You could see in a moment that he was a man of genius. The room was
lighted with gas. Was it possible that the immortal author of
"DICKENS'S Works" was before me? [Upon the table was a cigar, half
consumed, an inkstand, three pen-holders, a bundle of envelopes, a
brass key, several bouquets, a paper-cutter, a stick of sealing-wax, a
quantity of writing-paper, a table-cloth (spread), a newspaper (the
date has escaped me), and such other things as are usually on such
tables.]</p>
      <p>DICKENS, as soon as he saw me, stopped writing, wiped his pen,
ran his fingers through his hair, took out his watch and wound it up,
brushed his coat and put it on (not forgetting to place a rose in the
button-hole), and then, waving his hands very gracefully (he wore
high-priced studs and a pair of elaborately built sleeve-buttons),
addressed me as follows:&#8212;</p>
      <p>Mr. DICKENS <i>(with tender embrace)</i> SARSFIELD!!!!</p>
      <p>Mr. YOUNG <i>(representing American Literature)</i>
CHARLES!!!!</p>
      <p>The remainder of our conversation was devoted to minor topics.</p>
      <p>Early one morning we started from the Parker House, and
walking rapidly over West Boston bridge, passed through Cambridge, by
the Colleges, and kept on travelling, without speaking a word, the best
part of a couple of days, I should judge, though I didn't have my watch
with me. Suddenly he asked the name of the town we were rapidly
approaching.</p>
      <p>"Great Harrington," said I.</p>
      <p>"Is it possible?" said he. And we turned and walked home again.</p>
      <p>His first reading in America was a private one to me. We had
come in from a thirty-mile walk, and I was somewhat tired. Taking up
the second volume of his History of England, he began in an easy,
careless way. So did I. I went to sleep. Just as he was finishing the
book I woke up; and when he asked me how I liked it, I told him frankly
that, in my opinion, it never would do in the world&#8212;the plot was too
eccentric.</p>
      <p>He was a kind man. Frequently he would ride for days together
up and down a railroad, for no other purpose than to help take cinders
out of people's eyes.</p>
      <p>He was fond of oysters, of children, dogs, and an
international copyright. I remember his meeting me once on Broadway and
he didn't recognize me. He never mentioned the incident afterward. It
has been said that he was also fond of dress. I regret that I never
asked him about this, though I recall the circumstance of my inquiring
where he had his vests made. Said he; "My waistcoats were made abroad."</p>
      <p>He never liked to sit for his photograph; consequently, he
generally stood up.</p>
      <p>It pleased him to receive letters requesting his autograph and
a lock of his hair. The articles were invariably sent by return mail.
He was also gratified at the privilege of shaking hands with people
whom he was never to see again. I once humored him by introducing in a
body two fire companies and a Sunday school.</p>
      <p>As we parted he gave me excellent advice: "Write with vigor,"
said he, "with sincerity, and blue ink; but don't write novels. It
might injure the sale of my books." I promised him I would not, and we
saw each other no more.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
